# Getting started
The Windows API is a project built by Cassitly & Niwatori, using a bunch of languages to allow LLMs to use the general operating system (which is, as of right now), Windows.
Installing the windows api should be pretty straight-forward. Please check the [installation guide](./Installation%20Guide) on how to install and bootstrap the windows api from source.
