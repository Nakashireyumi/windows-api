## What is a resource?
This folder is used to host configuration files for each package (in any language), and also file assets like images, html files, etc.
A resource is also a file, used either by individual applications. Or by an entire contributed package (under a contributor's name).

## How to add a resource
You can't. Unless your contribution is going to use that resource, then your resource won't be used.
